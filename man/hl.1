.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBhl\fR higlights (using ANSI escape sequences) instances of \fIPATTERN\fR in the named input \fIFILEs\fR or standard in if none are specified\. \fBhl\fR\'s goal is to assist visually scanning such output, but without trimming that output as \fBgrep(1)\fR would\. The most common use\-case is when trying to scan the output of a \fBgrep\fR invocation that has complex data or long lines\. In this case, you don\'t want to further grep the output for the term you\'re looking for, bit instead simply need a visual cue as to where the secondary search term is in the output\.
.
.P
\fIPATTERN\fR can be a plain string, or a regular expression\.
.
